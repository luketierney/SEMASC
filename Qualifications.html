    <h2>Last year I ran for Student Council and got elected as Freshman Vice President and last June, I was reelected as VP. During my time as a Student Counselor, I have been part of the School Council where Students, Teachers, Parents, and Administration meet to discuss the future of SSVT by working on the School Improvement Plan. At the beginning of this year, I became CIT's Student Advisor. As the Student Advisor for CIT, I attent meetings with the instructors of CIT, Alumni of the shop, and administration where we discuss the future of CIT and its curriculum. During my time in CIT, I have gotten Microsoft Technology Associate certificates for Operating System Fundamentals, Networking Fundamentals, and Security Fundamentals. Along with these I have also been OSHA 10-hour certified. </h2>
