        <h3>Hello, I'm currently the Sophomore Vice President at South Shore Vocational Technical High School where I am in Computer Information Technology or CIT for short. I started learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript when I was in sixth grade on Khan Academy. Now I significantly increased my knowledge of these programming languages, learned more languages, gone to ID Tech summer camp, and got multiple certifications related to computers. I have spent every other week of my schooling for the past two years and lots of my freetime learning more and more about computers. In Freshman year while we were still on a hybrid schedule and I wasn't able to meet many of my fellow students, I ran for the Student Council and won as Vice President. Since then, I have spent lots of my time working to be the best Student Council member I can be and improving the school.</h3>
