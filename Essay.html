        <br><h1>My Application Essay</h1>
        <p id="essay">My experiences with web design and leadership will allow me to better improve the SEMASC website, perform other needed functions, and help improve our community as a whole. My experiences with web design being that I am in Computer Information Technology and have spent lots of my free time improving on my programming skills. In CIT, I have built numerous websites about different computer-related topics, have worked in different programming languages, worked in graphic design programs, am in AP Computer Science Principles, and have gotten three different computer-related certifications. In my free time, I have spent many hours improving my programming skills in various programming languages including all necessary ones for web development, and have attended ID Tech summer camp to better train myself. These numerous things will all allow me to better build and improve onto the SEMASC website and perform other tasks required of a Webmaster. Some of my experiences in leadership are that I have been Vice President of my class since freshman year, I am in School Council where we work on the School Improvement Plan to better improve future years experience at the school, and I am the CIT Student Advisor where I work with the CIT instructors and past alumni to improve the future curriculum of the shop. These leadership skills would help me better interact with the SEMASC community and the rest of the executive board. It would also help me better understand what SEMASC wants in its website, digital photography, multimedia presentations, and any other function I would perform. The main goal I have for when I am Webmaster is to add an announcement page to the SEMASC website to keep the community updated on all upcoming events or messages from the executive board. All of my experiences with web design and leadership will better allow me to improve and implement my goals for the website, perform other functions needed of a Webmaster, and help improve our community as a whole.
